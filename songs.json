[The car changes colours]I mean, blue with orange wheels.\nGEORGE:\nIt's all in the mind.\n\n[They all get into the car.]\n\nRINGO:\nCome on, move over, I'm driving.\nGEORGE:\nI got here first.\n\n[They argue about who will drive.]\n\nRINGO/GEORGE:\nI'll drive, if you like... No, you sit in the middle... I'm sitting in the middle... You said you were driving... I am driving... I'll get in the back, then.\n\n[Finally, they depart. A car crash is heard. They return and open a door. Inside the room there is a girl lying on a bed. King-Kong looks through the window and grabs the girl.]\n\nJOHN:\nDo you think we're interrupting something?\nRINGO:\nI think so. We'd better find Paul, hadn't we?\n\n[JOHN opens another door. A train is coming at full speed. John closes the door, scared.]\n\nGEORGE:\nIt's all in the mind.\nJOHN:\nTry one of those doors.\n\n[RINGO opens a door. Inside the room there is a loud party.]\n\nGEORGE:\nYes, they do look very nice, don't they?\nRINGO:\nYes, they do.\nJOHN:\nThey do, though, don't they?\nGEORGE:\nYes, they do.\nRINGO:\nDon't dey, dough?\nGEORGE:\nDough?\n\n[PAUL meets them.]\n\nJOHN:\nDon't ask. Dat's dough.\nPAUL:\nWhat's the matter, folks?\nRINGO:\nBlue Meanies.\nFRED:\nWell, lads, what do you think?\nJOHN [as they walk]:\nI think that...\nFRED:\nRemember, there'll be rough seas ahead. So, what do you think?\nPAUL:\nWell, then, um...\nFRED:\nPounding, overwhelming waves. What do you think of that?\nJOHN:\nWell, I think that...\nRINGO:\nAs a matter of fact, I...\nALL BEATLES:\nI think...\nFRED:\nWell?\nRINGO:\nI've forgotten.\n\n[They all go outside and stop in front of the submarine.]\n\nFRED:\nRight, then, let's get this vessel shipshape.\nJOHN:\nI kind of like the way it is, submarine shape.\n\n[0:22:18 THE JOURNEY BEGINS]\n\nWe see a series of landscapes.

How do you start this thing?\nFRED:\nIt starts with a Blue Meanie attack.\nJOHN:\nSupposing there's no Blue Meanies in the neighbourhood?\nFRED:\nThen you start looking for a switch.\nRINGO:\nPerhaps this is it.\n\n[The submarine sails into a strange world.]\n\n[0:23:22 THE BEATLES: ALL TOGETHER NOW]\nOne, two, three, four / Can I have a little more?\nFive, six, seven, eight, nine, ten / I love you\nA, B, C, D / Can I bring my friend to tea?\nE, F, G, H, I, J / I love you\nSail the ship\nChop the tree\nSkip the rope\nLook at me\nAll together now\nAll together now (all together now)\u2026\nBlack, white, green, red / Can I take my friend to bed?\nPink, brown, yellow, orange and blue / I love you (All together now)\nAll together now (all together now),\nall together now (all together now)...\nSail the ship\nChop the tree\nSkip the rope\nLook at me\nAll together now\nAll together now (all together now)\u2026\n\n[0:25:30 THE SEA OF TIME]\n\nRINGO:\nWhat time is it?\nJOHN:\nIt's time to time.\nPAUL:\nLook, the hands are slowing down.\n\n[The submarine sails backwards.]\n\nPAUL:\nDo you ever get the feeling...\nJOHN:\nYeah.\nPAUL:\n\u2026 that things aren't as rosy as they appear to be under the surface?\nRINGO:\nWhat's happening, John?\nJOHN:\nWell, in my humble opinion, we've become involved in Einstein's time-space continuum theory.\nGEORGE:\nAll right.\nJOHN:\nRelatively speaking, that is.\nGEORGE:\nOf course. Maybe time's gone on strike.\nRINGO:\nWhat for?\nGEORGE:\nShorter hours.\nRINGO:\nI don't blame it. It must be very tiring being time, mustn't it?\nJOHN & PAUL:\nWhy?\nRINGO:\nIt's a twenty-four hour day, isn't it?\nJOHN:\nYou surprise me, Ringo.\nRINGO:\nWhy?\nJOHN:\nDealing in abstracts.\nRINGO:\nJust because I'm a drummer... I don't half feel funny.\n\n[RINGO shrinks, becoming younger]\n\nPAUL [also getting younger]:\nYou're not half the lad you used to be.\nGEORGE [getting younger]\nLook, everything's getting bigger.\nJOHN [getting younger]:\nIt's not. It's us that are getting smaller...\nRINGO [mourning]:\nI want my mam.\nFRED:\nAnd younger. There you are, lads. Old Fred will get you out of all this.\nRINGO [pointing outside]\nLook at that!\nGEORGE:\nIt's all a load of Father Xmas's.\nJOHN:\nIt's not. It's Father Time.\nGEORGE:\nHow do you know?\nJOHN:\nI read it in a book.\nFRED:\nI don't want to alarm you, but the years are going backwards.\nGEORGE:\nWhat's that mean, old Fred?\nFRED:\nIt means if we slip back through time at this rate, very soon we'll all disappear up our own existence.\nJOHN:\nWhat are we gonna do, then?\nFRED:\nWe could always try a few buttons.\nRINGO [sobbing]:\nI want my mam.\nFRED:\nTime's fast running out for us, I'm afraid!\nJOHN:\nCan't we do something to the clock?\nGEORGE:\nWhat do you mean, John?\nJOHN:\nMove the hands forward, see what happens.\nFRED:\nClever lad.\n\n[JOHN forces the clockwise and the submarine goes forwards.]\n\nJOHN:\nSomething strange is happening. It's speeding up now.\nPAUL [looking outside]:\nFunny... a submarine remarkably like our own.\nJOHN:\nUncannily.\nRINGO:\nThere's someone in it. Look.\nJOHN:\nAnd they're waving.\nRINGO:\nIt's a group of fellas.\nJOHN:\nWave back. Maybe we're both part of a vast yellow submarine fleet.\nRINGO:\nThere's only two of us.\nJOHN:\nThen I would suggest that yonder yellow submarine is one of ourselves\u2026\nFRED:\nGoing backwards...\nJOHN:\n\u2026 in time!\nGEORGE:\nLook at Ringo.\n\n[RINGO is getting older, and so the rest.]\n\nJOHN:\nOh dear, we're all the same.\nPAUL:\nSenile delinquents.\nGEORGE:\nAnd I can hear my beard growing.\nRINGO:\nWe'd better do something.\n\n[0:28:20 THE BEATLES: WHEN I\u2019M SIXTY FOUR]\nWhen I get older, losing my hair\nMany years from now\nWill you still be sending me a valentine\nBirthday greetings, bottle of wine\nIf I'd been out till quarter to three\nWould you lock the door?\nWill you still need me,\nwill you still feed me\nWhen I'm sixty-four?\nYou'll be older, too\nAnd if you say the word\nI could stay with you\nI could be handy mending a fuse\nWhen your lights have gone\nYou can knit a sweater by the fireside\nSunday mornings, go for a ride\n[As Paul sings, time is going back and The Beatles turn back to their real age.]\n[A text can be read: \u201csixty-four years is 33.661.440 minutes and one minute is a\nlong time\u2026 Let us demonstrate\u201d.]\nDoing the garden, digging the weeds\nWho could ask for more?\nWill you still need me,\nwill you still feed me\nWhen I'm sixty-four?\n[A series of well illustrated numbers accompany the voice of Paul form 1 to 64, matching the last one with the end of the song.]\nEvery summer we can rent a cottage\nin the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear\nWe shall scrimp and save\nGrandchildren on your knee,\nVera, Chuck and Dave\nSend me a postcard, drop me a line\nStating point of view\nIndicate precisely\nwhat you mean to say\nYours sincerely, wasting away\nGive me your answer, fill in a form,\nmine forever more\nWill you still need me,\nwill you still feed me\nWhen I'm sixty-four?\n\nJOHN:\nWell, correct me if I'm wrong, gentlemen, but would you agree that we have been passing through the Sea of Time?\nRINGO:\nThat would explain a few things.

Or was it old?\nJOHN:\nWhat kind of a sea is this?\nFRED:\nThe Sea of Science.\nJOHN:\nOh, yeah.\n\n[0:31:15 THE BEATLES: A NORTHERN SONG]\nIf you're listening to this song\nYou may think the chords are going wrong\nBut they're not\nHe just wrote it like that\nWhen you're listening late at night\nYou may think the band are not quite right\nBut they are\nThey just play it like that\nIt doesn't really matter\nWhat chords I play\nWhat words I say\nOr time of day it is\nCause it's only a Northern Song\nIt doesn't really matter\nWhat clothes I wear\nOr how I fare or if my hair is brown\nWhen it's only a Northern Song\nIf you think the harmony\nIs a little dark and out of key\nYou're correct\nThere's nobody there\nAnd I told you there's no-one there.\n\n[0:33:46 A MONSTER WITH A TRUNK AND TUSKS]\n\n[As the song sounded The Beatles evolved through the space. When they come back to the submarine a strange animal enters with them.]\n\nGEORGE:\nHe looks wrong.\nPAUL:\nHe doesn't look at all well.\nGEORGE:\nIn fact, he's horrible.\nJOHN [hiding.]:\nHe's so ugly.\nALL:\nReally ugly!\n\n[The animal breaks to mourn.]\n\nFRED:\nSomebody push a button.\n\n[RINGO does so and the animal is ejected outside the submarine to the Sea of Monsters.]\n\n[0:34:18 SEA OF MONSTERS]\n\nJOHN:\nThere's a cyclops.\nPAUL:\nCan't be. He's got two eyes.\nJOHN:\nThen it must be a bi-cyclops.\nGEORGE:\nThere's another one.\nJOHN:\nA whole cyclopedia.\n\n[Among the monsters there is one that swallows everything like a vacuum. The BEATLES look out the hatch.]\n\nJOHN:\nThere's a school of whales.\nRINGO:\nThey look a bit old for school.\nPAUL:\nUniversity, then.\nRINGO [driving the submarine]:\nUniversity of Whales. They look like dropouts to me.\nFRED:\nYou've got to steer clear!\nRINGO:\nSteer clear?\nFRED:\nYes, steer. Clear?\nRINGO:\nYes, dear.\n\n[RINGO presses a button. The submarine shows a big smile. The whales smile too.]\n\nFRED:\nNow, whatever you do, don't touch that button.\nRINGO:\nWhich button?\nFRED:\nThat one.\nRINGO:\nThis one?\n\n[RINGO presses the button and is ejected from the submarine onto the back of a dinosaur. Before he is eaten, he is rescued by a horse-like creature.]\n\nFRED:\nThat was the panic button.\nPAUL:\nPoor Ringo.\nJOHN:\nPoor lad.\nGEORGE:\nNever did no harm to no-one.\nJOHN:\nLads, now Ringo's gone, what are we gonna do?\nFRED:\nLearn to sing trios.\nPAUL:\nNo, let's save the poor devil.\nJOHN:\nI see footsteps.\nFRED:\nIt's a pair of kinky boot-beasts.\nJOHN:\nPreparing to attack.\n\n[The boots try to step on the submarine, but PAUL presses a button and the submarine steps on the boots.]\n\nJOHN:\nI don't half miss Ringo.\nPAUL:\nHe's far out there.\nJOHN:\nAlways was.\nRINGO:\n'H' is for hurry!\nPAUL:\nHere comes Ringo!\n\n[RINGO rides the horse creature.]\n\nJOHN:\nThere goes Ringo.\n\n[A boxing monster approaches the submarine.]\n\nGEORGE:\nIt's seen us.\nFRED:\nFind a boxing button.\nPAUL:\nWhoever heard of a boxing button?\nJOHN:\nWho cares?

We hear \u201cAir on the G-string\u201d, de Bach until the cigar explodes.]\n\nGEORGE:\nThere goes Ringo again.\nJOHN:\nRides well, doesn't he?\nRINGO:\n'E' is for ergent...\n\n[The vacuum monster appears again.]\n\nFRED:\nOh no, not the dreaded vacuum again.\nPAUL:\nWe'll be sucked into oblivion.\nGEORGE:\nOr even further.\nFRED:\nPut her in reverse.\nJOHN:\nSo long, sucker.\nPAUL:\nToo much.\nGEORGE:\nToo soon.\nFRED:\nReverse!

'P' is for please...\nJOHN:\nSo, press a button.\n\n[0:39:33. The seventh cavalry leaves the submarine and rescues RINGO.]\n\nJOHN:\nHow was it, Ringo?\nRINGO [pulling arrows off himself]:\n'Arrowing.\n\n[The vacuum monster keeps gobbling other monsters.]\n\nFRED:\nLook who's back. Full speed ahead.\nRINGO:\nOh, no.\nJOHN:\nThe motor's packing in.\nFRED:\nBy all the sea nymphs, we're losing power. We're being swallowed. What shall we do?\nPAUL:\nServe tea.\nJOHN:\nLovely.\n\n[The vacuum monster swallows everything, including itself.]\n\n[The submarine is left in nothing.]\n\nFRED:\nBy Neptune's knickerbockers, she's puttered out.\nJOHN:\nMaybe we should call a road service.\nPAUL:\nCan't. No road.\nRINGO:\nAnd we're not sub-scribers.\nJOHN, PAUL, GEORGE:\nSubscribers! Oh!\nGEORGE:\nI know something about motors. Let me have a look.\nFRED:\nHere.\nGEORGE:\nIs that the motor?\nFRED:\nCan't you tell one when you see one?\nGEORGE:\nOf course I can.

Look at this.\nJOHN:\nWhat do you think it is?\nGEORGE:\nNothing.\nRINGO:\nLooks like nothing.\nPAUL:\nIt's a local inhabitant.\nRINGO:\nHe's probably one of the nothings.\nPAUL:\nAt least that's something. Let's show him our motor.\nJOHN:\nSteady on.

[Suddenly choleric] Tomorrow, the world! Bring in my Bluebird.\nPEPPERLAND INHABITANTS\nWho? Who? Who?\nPAUL, GEORGE, RINGO\nWho? Who? Who?\nThe mouth of John expels the question WHO?\nA blue big glove crosses the air.\nCHIEF BLUE MEANIE\nAh! Here you are, my little Glovey-dovey. Go get thee hence and destroy yon upstarts.

Glove?\nFrom the mouth of John emerge the word GLOVE.\nGEORGE\nHe's a clever lad, isn't he?\nRINGO\nOpen your mouth, it won't hurt. [Try to see into the mouth of John] John, you haven't half got a big mouth, haven't you?\nGEORGE\nIt's easy. All you need is love.\nJOHN\nYes.\nAnd expeles again the word GLOVE, but this time the initial G vanishes.\n1:12:02 THE BEATLES : ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE\nLove, love, love (x3)\nThere's nothing you can do that can't be done\nNothing you can sing that can't be sung\nNothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game\nIt's easy\nAll you need is love\nAll you need is love\nAll you need is love, love,\nLove is all you need\nNothing you can know that isn't known,\nNothing you can see that isn't shown\nThere's nowhere you can be\nthat isn't where you're meant to be\nIt's easy\nAll you need is love, (All together now)\nAll you need is love, (Everybody)\nAll you need is love, love,\nLove is all you need\nAll you need is love\nAll you need is love\nAll you need is love, love\nThe words emerged from the mouth of John neutralize the glove attacks.\nJOHN\nGo, Glove, lovely Glove.\nRINGO\nYou took the words right out of my mouth, John.\nGEORGE\nHey, wait, and watch. [Floating] It's all in the mind, you know.\nLove is all you need\nLove is all you need\nEverything revives in Pepperland. The word NO becomes NOW and then KNOW.\nShe loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah\nThe meanies flee and The Beatles are acclaimed by the crowd.\nA little bit further they find a blue glass ball.\nGEORGE\nHey, that's a funny place to leave a goldfish bowl.\nJOHN\nIn Pepperland all things are possible.\nPAUL\nIt's not a goldfish bowl.\nRINGO\nJust a big glass bowl, then.\nPAUL\nYes, blue glass.\nRINGO\nIt must be from Kentucky.\nPaul knocks the bowl.

Pepper's...\nRINGO\nLonely...\nGEORGE\nHearts Club...\nGEORGE\nBand.\nJOHN\nThe resemblance is truly striking.

The people in the ball are obviously extensions of our own personalities, suspended, as it were, in time, frozen in space, according to the now famous Theory of Relativity, which, briefly explained, is simply a matter of taking two eggs...\nThe other three try to break the ball.\nPAUL\nJohn!\nJOHN\n\u2026 beating lightly and adding a little salt and pepper...\nGEORGE\nJohn!\nJOHN\nGeorge?\nGEORGE\nHow do we get them out?\nJOHN\nBreak the glass.\nGEORGE\nWe can't.

I wonder if...\nRingo sticks the hole on the ball. The ball gets empty.\nRINGO\nYeah, it still works.\nGEORGE\nWe take back all we said.\nJOHN\nYou're a genius.\nPAUL\nA sheer genius.\nRINGO\nI know, I know, I know. [Some colors get out of the ball] Like coloured telly.\nGEORGE\nLike crystal.\nPAUL\nThey're decanting.\nThe members of the Band face their peers.\nRINGO 2\nHello, brother.\nRINGO\nYeah, without a doubt.\nGEORGE\nWe're the spitting image of each other.\nGEORGE 2\nGolly, yeah.\nJOHN\nI'm led to believe that you're an extension of my personality.\nJOHN 2\nYes, I'm your alter-ego man.\nJOHN\nAnd I'm the ego man, goo goo, g'joob. [They walk together] I'm glad you asked me that. Because as a matter of fact there's a war on. Then, brothers in war, to the\nskirmish must we hence.\nJOHN 2\nShall we hence?\nPAUL\nLet's not waste time sitting on the hence. Beatles to battle. Charge!\nThe Blue Meanies attack again. The Beatles run for a hide.\nJOHN\nWe're surrounded.\nRINGO, pointing the four-headed dog\nNice dog, though.\nThe Beatles hide inside a hurdy-gurdy. John turns the crank and sings:\n1:17:26 THE BEATLES : HEY BULLDOG\nSheepdog... standing in the rain\nBullfrog... doing it again\nSome kind of happiness\nis measured out in miles\nWhat makes you think you're\nsomething special when you smile?\nChildlike... no one understands\nJack knife... in your sweaty hands\nSome kind of innocence\nis measured out in years\nYou don't know what it's like\nto listen to your fears\nYou can talk to me\nYou can talk to me\nYou can talk to me\nIf you're lonely you can talk to me\nBig man... walking in the park\nWigwam... frightened of the dark\nSome kind of solitude\nis measured out in you\nYou think you know me\nbut you haven't got a clue\nYou can talk to me,\nYou can talk to me\nYou can talk to me...\nif you're lonely you can talk to me\nHey, bulldog (x4)\nJohn to the dog:\nWhat do you say? Sing it.\nDo you know any more? Play it!\nTodos\nHey, bulldog.\nThe Beatles escape from the dog and the guards. Ringo finds Jeremy hanging from\nthe branch of a tree.\nRINGO\nJeremy, can it be you?\nJEREMY\nCan it be me? I think you'd better\ninquire of the guards,\nfor when I was captured,\nthey took all my cards.\nRINGO\nShh, that's enough, Jeremy. Come on, the whole world's being attacked.\nJEREMY\nWhat do you want me to do?\nDo you recommend fisticuffs\nversus the guard?\n[With a fighting manual in his hand Jeremy challenges the guard ]\nOh, guard! Blue Meanio!\nLeft to the nostril, right uppercut,\nright to the eyebrow, left to the gut.\nJeremy stumbles into a tree. An apple falls down and knocks out the meanie.

You're advancing the wrong way! Retreat backwards! Get back there now!\nThe Chief is swept along.\nCHIEF BLUE MEANIE\nMy kingdom for a horse!

Lennon has been presented as Billy Shears, but Ringo\u2019s voice is heard.\n01:08:49 THE MEANIES GATHER AROUND THEIR CHIEF\nCHIEF BLUE MEANIE\nAh! The hills are alive...\nASSISTANT\nWith the sound of music.\nThe Chief Blue Meanie hits his assistant. Then he gets a tantrum.\nCHIEF BLUE MEANIE\nWho is responsible for this?\nASSISTANT\nRimsky Korsakov?\nThe assistant is shot and kicking, but still resurfaces.\nASSISTANT\nGuy Lombardo?\nCHIEF BLUE MEANIE, laughs\nMy dear friend... let us not forget that heaven is blue. [Suddenly choleric] Tomorrow, the world! Bring in my Bluebird.\nPEPPERLAND INHABITANTS\nWho? Who? Who?\nPAUL, GEORGE, RINGO\nWho? Who? Who?\nThe mouth of John expels the question WHO?\nA blue big glove crosses the air.\nCHIEF BLUE MEANIE\nAh! Here you are, my little Glovey-dovey. Go get thee hence and destroy yon upstarts. [New rage] Smash them! Squash them! Crash them! Oblue-terate them!\nMEDICAL DOCTOR, as the Chief collapses\nHere, your Blueness, have some nasty medicine.\nCHIEF, exuberant\nThe Glove, the Glove, the Glove!\nPAUL, GEORGE, RINGO\nGlove? Glove? Glove?\nFrom the mouth of John emerge the word GLOVE.\nGEORGE\nHe's a clever lad, isn't he?\nRINGO\nOpen your mouth, it won't hurt. [Try to see into the mouth of John] John, you haven't half got a big mouth, haven't you?\nGEORGE\nIt's easy. All you need is love.\nJOHN\nYes.\nAnd expeles again the word GLOVE, but this time the initial G vanishes.\n1:12:02 THE BEATLES : ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE\nLove, love, love (x3)\nThere's nothing you can do that can't be done\nNothing you can sing that can't be sung\nNothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game\nIt's easy\nAll you need is love\nAll you need is love\nAll you need is love, love,\nLove is all you need\nNothing you can know that isn't known,\nNothing you can see that isn't shown\nThere's nowhere you can be\nthat isn't where you're meant to be\nIt's easy\nAll you need is love, (All together now)\nAll you need is love, (Everybody)\nAll you need is love, love,\nLove is all you need\nAll you need is love\nAll you need is love\nAll you need is love, love\nThe words emerged from the mouth of John neutralize the glove attacks.\nJOHN\nGo, Glove, lovely Glove.\nRINGO\nYou took the words right out of my mouth, John.\nGEORGE\nHey, wait, and watch. [Floating] It's all in the mind, you know.\nLove is all you need\nLove is all you need\nEverything revives in Pepperland. The word NO becomes NOW and then KNOW.\nShe loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah\nThe meanies flee and The Beatles are acclaimed by the crowd.\nA little bit further they find a blue glass ball.\nGEORGE\nHey, that's a funny place to leave a goldfish bowl.\nJOHN\nIn Pepperland all things are possible.\nPAUL\nIt's not a goldfish bowl.\nRINGO\nJust a big glass bowl, then.\nPAUL\nYes, blue glass.\nRINGO\nIt must be from Kentucky.\nPaul knocks the bowl. Some music starts to sound.\nJOHN\nThere's something inside.\nRINGO\nFour fellas.\nGEORGE\nWhat are they doing there?\nPAUL\nThey're not having a ball, that's for sure.\nJOHN\nIt can't be.\nPAUL\nIt's us.\nJOHN\nBut we're here.\nPAUL\nIt's Sgt. Pepper's...\nRINGO\nLonely...\nGEORGE\nHearts Club...\nGEORGE\nBand.\nJOHN\nThe resemblance is truly striking. If I could come in here I think the theory put forward\nby Einstein\u2026\nPAUL, spoofs an old song called \u2018Any old iron\u2019\nAny old Ein, any old Ein, any, any, any old Einstein.\nJOHN\n\u2026 could well be applied here. The people in the ball are obviously extensions of our own personalities, suspended, as it were, in time, frozen in space, according to the now famous Theory of Relativity, which, briefly explained, is simply a matter of taking two eggs...\nThe other three try to break the ball.\nPAUL\nJohn!\nJOHN\n\u2026 beating lightly and adding a little salt and pepper...\nGEORGE\nJohn!\nJOHN\nGeorge?\nGEORGE\nHow do we get them out?\nJOHN\nBreak the glass.\nGEORGE\nWe can't. It's Beatle-proof.\nJOHN\nNothing is Beatle-proof.\nPAUL, to Ringo\nHave you got your drumsticks with you? A drum break might shatter it.\nRINGO\nNo, I haven't.\nGEORGE\nHave a look in your pocket.\n1:15:50 \u201cBaby you\u2019re a rich man\u201d is heard.\nRINGO\nI've got a hole in my pocket. I wonder if...\nRingo sticks the hole on the ball. The ball gets empty.\nRINGO\nYeah, it still works.\nGEORGE\nWe take back all we said.\nJOHN\nYou're a genius.\nPAUL\nA sheer genius.\nRINGO\nI know, I know, I know. [Some colors get out of the ball] Like coloured telly.\nGEORGE\nLike crystal.\nPAUL\nThey're decanting.\nThe members of the Band face their peers.\nRINGO 2\nHello, brother.\nRINGO\nYeah, without a doubt.\nGEORGE\nWe're the spitting image of each other.\nGEORGE 2\nGolly, yeah.\nJOHN\nI'm led to believe that you're an extension of my personality.\nJOHN 2\nYes, I'm your alter-ego man.\nJOHN\nAnd I'm the ego man, goo goo, g'joob. [They walk together] I'm glad you asked me that. Because as a matter of fact there's a war on. Then, brothers in war, to the\nskirmish must we hence.\nJOHN 2\nShall we hence?\nPAUL\nLet's not waste time sitting on the hence. Beatles to battle. Charge!\nThe Blue Meanies attack again. The Beatles run for a hide.\nJOHN\nWe're surrounded.\nRINGO, pointing the four-headed dog\nNice dog, though.\nThe Beatles hide inside a hurdy-gurdy. John turns the crank and sings:\n1:17:26 THE BEATLES : HEY BULLDOG\nSheepdog... standing in the rain\nBullfrog... doing it again\nSome kind of happiness\nis measured out in miles\nWhat makes you think you're\nsomething special when you smile?\nChildlike... no one understands\nJack knife... in your sweaty hands\nSome kind of innocence\nis measured out in years\nYou don't know what it's like\nto listen to your fears\nYou can talk to me\nYou can talk to me\nYou can talk to me\nIf you're lonely you can talk to me\nBig man... walking in the park\nWigwam... frightened of the dark\nSome kind of solitude\nis measured out in you\nYou think you know me\nbut you haven't got a clue\nYou can talk to me,\nYou can talk to me\nYou can talk to me...\nif you're lonely you can talk to me\nHey, bulldog (x4)\nJohn to the dog:\nWhat do you say? Sing it.\nDo you know any more? Play it!\nTodos\nHey, bulldog.\nThe Beatles escape from the dog and the guards. Ringo finds Jeremy hanging from\nthe branch of a tree.\nRINGO\nJeremy, can it be you?\nJEREMY\nCan it be me? I think you'd better\ninquire of the guards,\nfor when I was captured,\nthey took all my cards.\nRINGO\nShh, that's enough, Jeremy. Come on, the whole world's being attacked.\nJEREMY\nWhat do you want me to do?\nDo you recommend fisticuffs\nversus the guard?\n[With a fighting manual in his hand Jeremy challenges the guard ]\nOh, guard! Blue Meanio!\nLeft to the nostril, right uppercut,\nright to the eyebrow, left to the gut.\nJeremy stumbles into a tree. An apple falls down and knocks out the meanie. Ringo\ncongratulates Jeremy.\nRINGO\nJeremy!\nJEREMY\nCome on, Ringo!\nThe Chief treats to stem the rout.\nCHIEF BLUE MEANIE\nGet back! Get back! Once more unto the breach, dear Meanies! You're advancing the wrong way! Retreat backwards! Get back there now!\nThe Chief is swept along.\nCHIEF BLUE MEANIE\nMy kingdom for a horse! [Jeremy comes close to him] I think I'll tear him up into little pieces.\nJEREMY\nHe does, does he?\nCHIEF\nI think I'll make a blueburger out of him.\nJEREMY\nHa-ha, I don't care what you think.\nCHIEF\nYou don't, eh? We'll soon see about that.\nJEREMY\nHe does in truth seem quite annoyed,\n[Opens the manual]\nsome reference material\nbefore I'm destroyed.\nWhere ground is soft most often grows,\nArise, arise, arouse, a rose.\n[Suddenly, a rose arise in the Chief nose]\nA rosy nose?\nCHIEF\nSpeak your last piece!\nJEREMY\nPeace, peace,\nsupplant the doom and the gloom.\nTurn off what is sour,\nturn into a flower and bloom, bloom.\nHa-ha, bloom, ha-ha, bloom,\nbloom, bloom...\nA lot of pink roses cover the whole body of the Chief. He flees crazy.\nRINGO\nFirst time I saw that Nowhere Man, that nobody, I knew he was somebody.\nJOHN\nYou're right. Hello there, blue people. Won't you join us? Buck up, and otherwise go\nmingle.

Here is the motor.\nPAUL\nI've got a little love.\nRINGO\nAnd I've got a hole in my pocket.\nPAUL\nA hole?\nRINGO\nHalf a hole, anyway.

Liverpool can be a lonely place on a Saturday night. And this is only Thursday morning. Compared with my life, Eleanor Rigby's was a gay, mad whirl. Nothing ever happens to me. I feel like an old, splintered drumstick. I'd jump into the River Mersey, but it looks like rain. Nothing ever happens to me.\n\n[As RINGO walks down Hope Street, is followed by the submarine. A bobby lies on the floor playing with a cat.]\n\nBOBBY:\nPuss, puss-puss. Puss, puss, puss. Here, pussy. Here, pussy, pussy, pussy. Here, pussy, pussy. [The Bobby sees Ringo] Ahem, er...\nRINGO:\nWould you believe me if I told you I was being followed by a yellow submarine?\nBOBBY:\nNo, I would not.\nRINGO:\nOh yeah, I didn't think you would.\n\n[Ringo goes up a hill to reach The Pier, the house where he lives with the other Beatles.]\n\nRINGO:\nI could have sworn there was a yellow submarine. But that isn't logical, is it? It must have been one of them unidentified flying cupcakes or a figment of my imagination.\nBut I don't have an imagination.\n\n[RINGO enters the house. FRED comes and knocks at the door.]\n\nFRED:\nHelp, help, help!\nRINGO [from inside]:\nThanks, I don't need any.\nFRED:\nHelp!

No, you sit in the middle... I'm sitting in the middle... You said you were driving... I am driving... I'll get in the back, then.\n\n[Finally, they depart. A car crash is heard. They return and open a door. Inside the room there is a girl lying on a bed. King-Kong looks through the window and grabs the girl.]\n\nJOHN:\nDo you think we're interrupting something?\nRINGO:\nI think so. We'd better find Paul, hadn't we?\n\n[JOHN opens another door. A train is coming at full speed. John closes the door, scared.]\n\nGEORGE:\nIt's all in the mind.\nJOHN:\nTry one of those doors.\n\n[RINGO opens a door. Inside the room there is a loud party.]\n\nGEORGE:\nYes, they do look very nice, don't they?\nRINGO:\nYes, they do.\nJOHN:\nThey do, though, don't they?\nGEORGE:\nYes, they do.\nRINGO:\nDon't dey, dough?\nGEORGE:\nDough?\n\n[PAUL meets them.]\n\nJOHN:\nDon't ask.

What do you think of that?\nJOHN:\nWell, I think that...\nRINGO:\nAs a matter of fact, I...\nALL BEATLES:\nI think...\nFRED:\nWell?\nRINGO:\nI've forgotten.\n\n[They all go outside and stop in front of the submarine.]\n\nFRED:\nRight, then, let's get this vessel shipshape.\nJOHN:\nI kind of like the way it is, submarine shape.\n\n[0:22:18 THE JOURNEY BEGINS]\n\nWe see a series of landscapes.

How do you start this thing?\nFRED:\nIt starts with a Blue Meanie attack.\nJOHN:\nSupposing there's no Blue Meanies in the neighbourhood?\nFRED:\nThen you start looking for a switch.\nRINGO:\nPerhaps this is it.\n\n[The submarine sails into a strange world.]\n\n[0:23:22 THE BEATLES: ALL TOGETHER NOW]\nOne, two, three, four / Can I have a little more?\nFive, six, seven, eight, nine, ten / I love you\nA, B, C, D / Can I bring my friend to tea?\nE, F, G, H, I, J / I love you\nSail the ship\nChop the tree\nSkip the rope\nLook at me\nAll together now\nAll together now (all together now)\u2026\nBlack, white, green, red / Can I take my friend to bed?\nPink, brown, yellow, orange and blue / I love you (All together now)\nAll together now (all together now),\nall together now (all together now)...\nSail the ship\nChop the tree\nSkip the rope\nLook at me\nAll together now\nAll together now (all together now)\u2026\n\n[0:25:30 THE SEA OF TIME]\n\nRINGO:\nWhat time is it?\nJOHN:\nIt's time to time.\nPAUL:\nLook, the hands are slowing down.\n\n[The submarine sails backwards.]\n\nPAUL:\nDo you ever get the feeling...\nJOHN:\nYeah.\nPAUL:\n\u2026 that things aren't as rosy as they appear to be under the surface?\nRINGO:\nWhat's happening, John?\nJOHN:\nWell, in my humble opinion, we've become involved in Einstein's time-space continuum theory.\nGEORGE:\nAll right.\nJOHN:\nRelatively speaking, that is.\nGEORGE:\nOf course. Maybe time's gone on strike.\nRINGO:\nWhat for?\nGEORGE:\nShorter hours.\nRINGO:\nI don't blame it.

It's Father Time.\nGEORGE:\nHow do you know?\nJOHN:\nI read it in a book.\nFRED:\nI don't want to alarm you, but the years are going backwards.\nGEORGE:\nWhat's that mean, old Fred?\nFRED:\nIt means if we slip back through time at this rate, very soon we'll all disappear up our own existence.\nJOHN:\nWhat are we gonna do, then?\nFRED:\nWe could always try a few buttons.\nRINGO [sobbing]:\nI want my mam.\nFRED:\nTime's fast running out for us, I'm afraid!\nJOHN:\nCan't we do something to the clock?\nGEORGE:\nWhat do you mean, John?\nJOHN:\nMove the hands forward, see what happens.\nFRED:\nClever lad.\n\n[JOHN forces the clockwise and the submarine goes forwards.]\n\nJOHN:\nSomething strange is happening. It's speeding up now.\nPAUL [looking outside]:\nFunny... a submarine remarkably like our own.\nJOHN:\nUncannily.\nRINGO:\nThere's someone in it. Look.\nJOHN:\nAnd they're waving.\nRINGO:\nIt's a group of fellas.\nJOHN:\nWave back. Maybe we're both part of a vast yellow submarine fleet.\nRINGO:\nThere's only two of us.\nJOHN:\nThen I would suggest that yonder yellow submarine is one of ourselves\u2026\nFRED:\nGoing backwards...\nJOHN:\n\u2026 in time!\nGEORGE:\nLook at Ringo.\n\n[RINGO is getting older, and so the rest.]\n\nJOHN:\nOh dear, we're all the same.\nPAUL:\nSenile delinquents.\nGEORGE:\nAnd I can hear my beard growing.\nRINGO:\nWe'd better do something.\n\n[0:28:20 THE BEATLES: WHEN I\u2019M SIXTY FOUR]\nWhen I get older, losing my hair\nMany years from now\nWill you still be sending me a valentine\nBirthday greetings, bottle of wine\nIf I'd been out till quarter to three\nWould you lock the door?\nWill you still need me,\nwill you still feed me\nWhen I'm sixty-four?\nYou'll be older, too\nAnd if you say the word\nI could stay with you\nI could be handy mending a fuse\nWhen your lights have gone\nYou can knit a sweater by the fireside\nSunday mornings, go for a ride\n[As Paul sings, time is going back and The Beatles turn back to their real age.]\n[A text can be read: \u201csixty-four years is 33.661.440 minutes and one minute is a\nlong time\u2026 Let us demonstrate\u201d.]\nDoing the garden, digging the weeds\nWho could ask for more?\nWill you still need me,\nwill you still feed me\nWhen I'm sixty-four?\n[A series of well illustrated numbers accompany the voice of Paul form 1 to 64, matching the last one with the end of the song.]\nEvery summer we can rent a cottage\nin the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear\nWe shall scrimp and save\nGrandchildren on your knee,\nVera, Chuck and Dave\nSend me a postcard, drop me a line\nStating point of view\nIndicate precisely\nwhat you mean to say\nYours sincerely, wasting away\nGive me your answer, fill in a form,\nmine forever more\nWill you still need me,\nwill you still feed me\nWhen I'm sixty-four?\n\nJOHN:\nWell, correct me if I'm wrong, gentlemen, but would you agree that we have been passing through the Sea of Time?\nRINGO:\nThat would explain a few things. I'm glad I'm not young any more. Or was it old?\nJOHN:\nWhat kind of a sea is this?\nFRED:\nThe Sea of Science.\nJOHN:\nOh, yeah.\n\n[0:31:15 THE BEATLES: A NORTHERN SONG]\nIf you're listening to this song\nYou may think the chords are going wrong\nBut they're not\nHe just wrote it like that\nWhen you're listening late at night\nYou may think the band are not quite right\nBut they are\nThey just play it like that\nIt doesn't really matter\nWhat chords I play\nWhat words I say\nOr time of day it is\nCause it's only a Northern Song\nIt doesn't really matter\nWhat clothes I wear\nOr how I fare or if my hair is brown\nWhen it's only a Northern Song\nIf you think the harmony\nIs a little dark and out of key\nYou're correct\nThere's nobody there\nAnd I told you there's no-one there.\n\n[0:33:46 A MONSTER WITH A TRUNK AND TUSKS]\n\n[As the song sounded The Beatles evolved through the space. When they come back to the submarine a strange animal enters with them.]\n\nGEORGE:\nHe looks wrong.\nPAUL:\nHe doesn't look at all well.\nGEORGE:\nIn fact, he's horrible.\nJOHN [hiding.]:\nHe's so ugly.\nALL:\nReally ugly!\n\n[The animal breaks to mourn.]\n\nFRED:\nSomebody push a button.\n\n[RINGO does so and the animal is ejected outside the submarine to the Sea of Monsters.]\n\n[0:34:18 SEA OF MONSTERS]\n\nJOHN:\nThere's a cyclops.\nPAUL:\nCan't be.

The BEATLES look out the hatch.]\n\nJOHN:\nThere's a school of whales.\nRINGO:\nThey look a bit old for school.\nPAUL:\nUniversity, then.\nRINGO [driving the submarine]:\nUniversity of Whales. They look like dropouts to me.\nFRED:\nYou've got to steer clear!\nRINGO:\nSteer clear?\nFRED:\nYes, steer. Clear?\nRINGO:\nYes, dear.\n\n[RINGO presses a button. The submarine shows a big smile. The whales smile too.]\n\nFRED:\nNow, whatever you do, don't touch that button.\nRINGO:\nWhich button?\nFRED:\nThat one.\nRINGO:\nThis one?\n\n[RINGO presses the button and is ejected from the submarine onto the back of a dinosaur. Before he is eaten, he is rescued by a horse-like creature.]\n\nFRED:\nThat was the panic button.\nPAUL:\nPoor Ringo.\nJOHN:\nPoor lad.\nGEORGE:\nNever did no harm to no-one.\nJOHN:\nLads, now Ringo's gone, what are we gonna do?\nFRED:\nLearn to sing trios.\nPAUL:\nNo, let's save the poor devil.\nJOHN:\nI see footsteps.\nFRED:\nIt's a pair of kinky boot-beasts.\nJOHN:\nPreparing to attack.\n\n[The boots try to step on the submarine, but PAUL presses a button and the submarine steps on the boots.]\n\nJOHN:\nI don't half miss Ringo.\nPAUL:\nHe's far out there.\nJOHN:\nAlways was.\nRINGO:\n'H' is for hurry!\nPAUL:\nHere comes Ringo!\n\n[RINGO rides the horse creature.]\n\nJOHN:\nThere goes Ringo.\n\n[A boxing monster approaches the submarine.]\n\nGEORGE:\nIt's seen us.\nFRED:\nFind a boxing button.\nPAUL:\nWhoever heard of a boxing button?\nJOHN:\nWho cares? Find one.\n\n[The boxing monster hits the submarine.]\n\nFRED [pushing a button]:\nFire one!\n\n[The submarine expels lot of strange gadgets, including a banner with the words \u201cThe Rolling Stones\u201d.]\n\nFRED:\nUh-oh, wrong one.\nJOHN:\nThat.\n\n[The submarine flatters the monsters with a cigar. We hear \u201cAir on the G-string\u201d, de Bach until the cigar explodes.]\n\nGEORGE:\nThere goes Ringo again.\nJOHN:\nRides well, doesn't he?\nRINGO:\n'E' is for ergent...\n\n[The vacuum monster appears again.]\n\nFRED:\nOh no, not the dreaded vacuum again.\nPAUL:\nWe'll be sucked into oblivion.\nGEORGE:\nOr even further.\nFRED:\nPut her in reverse.\nJOHN:\nSo long, sucker.\nPAUL:\nToo much.\nGEORGE:\nToo soon.\nFRED:\nReverse! Reverse!\nJOHN:\nRingo time.\n\n[Another monster is swallowed by the vacuum monster.]\n\nRINGO:\n'L' is for love me...\n\n[Indians go chasing RINGO.]\n\nJOHN:\nIndians!\nRINGO:\nHelp! Help! 'P' is for please...\nJOHN:\nSo, press a button.\n\n[0:39:33. The seventh cavalry leaves the submarine and rescues RINGO.]\n\nJOHN:\nHow was it, Ringo?\nRINGO [pulling arrows off himself]:\n'Arrowing.\n\n[The vacuum monster keeps gobbling other monsters.]\n\nFRED:\nLook who's back. Full speed ahead.\nRINGO:\nOh, no.\nJOHN:\nThe motor's packing in.\nFRED:\nBy all the sea nymphs, we're losing power. We're being swallowed. What shall we do?\nPAUL:\nServe tea.\nJOHN:\nLovely.\n\n[The vacuum monster swallows everything, including itself.]\n\n[The submarine is left in nothing.]\n\nFRED:\nBy Neptune's knickerbockers, she's puttered out.\nJOHN:\nMaybe we should call a road service.\nPAUL:\nCan't. No road.\nRINGO:\nAnd we're not sub-scribers.\nJOHN, PAUL, GEORGE:\nSubscribers! Oh!\nGEORGE:\nI know something about motors. Let me have a look.\nFRED:\nHere.\nGEORGE:\nIs that the motor?\nFRED:\nCan't you tell one when you see one?\nGEORGE:\nOf course I can. Let me peruse it.\n\n[Put his finger on the motor and get shocked.]\n\nJOHN:\nWhat do you think?\nGEORGE:\nI think I burned my finger.\nRINGO [looking outside]:\nHere, lads. Look at this.\nJOHN:\nWhat do you think it is?\nGEORGE:\nNothing.\nRINGO:\nLooks like nothing.\nPAUL:\nIt's a local inhabitant.\nRINGO:\nHe's probably one of the nothings.\nPAUL:\nAt least that's something. Let's show him our motor.\nJOHN:\nSteady on. You don't want to show your motor to just anybody.\nGEORGE:\nBut this is a nobody.\nJEREMY:\nMedic, pedic, zed oblique,\norphic, morphic, dorphic, Greek.\nAd hoc, ad loc and quid pro quo.\nSo little time, so much to know.\nJOHN:\nCan you tell us where we're at?\nJEREMY:\nA true Socratic query, that.\nJOHN:\nAnd who the Billy Shears are you?\nJEREMY:\nWho? Who indeed am I?\n\n[He gives a different visiting card to each BEATLE.]\n\nJOHN [reading card]:\nJeremy?\nPAUL [reading card]:\nHillary?\nGEORGE [reading card]:\nBoob?\nRINGO [reading card]:\nPh.

Let's go somewhere.\nRINGO:\nWhat about him?\nJOHN:\nHe's happy enough going around in circles.\nRINGO:\nPoor little fella.\nPAUL:\nI don't know. Ringo's just a sentimentalist.\nRINGO:\nLook at him. Can't he come with us? [Goes over to JEREMY]\nMr. Boob, you can come with us, if you like.\nJEREMY:\nYou mean, you'd take a Nowhere Man?\nRINGO:\nCome on, we'll take you somewhere.\n\n[Inside the submarine, JOHN gives FRED the motor.]\n\nJOHN [to JEREMY]\nOkay, Booby. Down the hatch.\nJEREMY [laughing]:\nDown the hatch. A quite curious phrase.\nThe middle South Midlands\nVictorian phase.\nIt's usage undoubtedly on the increase.\nI must work it into\nmy New Statesman piece.\nJOHN:\nThat's the hatch, friend.\nJEREMY:\nIndeed.\nFRED:\nSteady now, crew.

A turn of the screw, and all is and all is new.\n\n[The submarine stars, but only FRED is on board.]\n\nFRED:\nI can't stop her.

Or for worse.\nJEREMY:\nI'm sorry about that.\nRINGO:\nBut he did fix the motor.\nPAUL:\nWhere are we?\n\n[They stand on a head. There are a lot of heads around.]\n\nJOHN:\nIt looks like the foothills.\nPAUL:\nThe foothills of what?\nJOHN:\nThe foothills of the headlands.\n\n[0:48:06 THE BEATLES: LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS]\nPicture yourself in a boat on a river\nWith tangerine trees\nand marmalade skies\nSomebody calls you,\nyou answer quite slowly\nA girl with kaleidoscope eyes\nCellophane flowers of yellow and green\nTowering over your head\nLook for the girl with the sun\nin her eyes and she's gone\nLucy in the sky with diamonds\nLucy in the sky with diamonds\nLucy in the sky with diamonds\nFollow her down to a bridge by a fountain\nWhere rocking horse people\neat marshmallow pies\nEveryone smiles\nas you drift past the flowers\nThat grow so incredibly high\nNewspaper taxis appear on the shore\nWaiting to take you away\nClimb in the back with your head\nin the clouds and you're gone\nLucy in the sky with diamonds\nLucy in the sky with diamonds\nLucy in the sky with diamonds\nPicture yourself on a train in a station\nWith Plasticine porters\nwith looking glass ties\nSuddenly someone is there at the turnstile\nThe girl with kaleidoscope eyes\nLucy in the sky with diamonds\u2026\n\n[0:51:09 ON THE FOOTHILLS OF THE HEADLANDS]\n\nJOHN:\nCarry on, lads, carry on.\nRINGO:\nCertainly was carrying on.\nJOHN:\nI feel a draft.\nPAUL:\nWe must be near the Sea of Holes. Don't you think we should ask somebody for directions?\nJOHN [talking to a mass of heads]\nExcuse us...\nPAUL:\nCan you tell us the way to Pepperland?\n\n[The heads point arrows, but the arrows point in circles.]\n\nJOHN:\nThanks.\nPAUL:\nGosh, look at all this dust? Where did it come from?\nJEREMY:\nA chemical error and quite imprecise. This is a condiment...\nRINGO:\nCondi...\nJEREMY:\nA spice.\nJOHN:\nHe's right, you know. It's pepper.\nPAUL:\nPepper?\nGEORGE:\nPepper.\n\n[They smell and sneeze. The mass of heads sneeze too. They fly into the Sea of Holes.]\n\n[0:52:08 THE SEA OF HOLES]\n\nRINGO:\nJohn? Paul? George?

The Sea of Holes... into the Sea of Green.\nJEREMY:\nHydrolate, verdant chrysodine.\nI think we're near the Sea of Green.\n\n[JEREMY is caught by the leg by a BLUE MEANIE.

I've made it, I'm back.\nGEORGE:\nWho's this?\nFRED:\nOur Lord Mayor. He's been bonked. [Ringo removes the apples]. Lord Mayor, sir... unbonk yourself.

[Try to see into the mouth of John] John, you haven't half got a big mouth, haven't you?\nGEORGE\nIt's easy. All you need is love.\nJOHN\nYes.\nAnd expeles again the word GLOVE, but this time the initial G vanishes.\n1:12:02 THE BEATLES : ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE\nLove, love, love (x3)\nThere's nothing you can do that can't be done\nNothing you can sing that can't be sung\nNothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game\nIt's easy\nAll you need is love\nAll you need is love\nAll you need is love, love,\nLove is all you need\nNothing you can know that isn't known,\nNothing you can see that isn't shown\nThere's nowhere you can be\nthat isn't where you're meant to be\nIt's easy\nAll you need is love, (All together now)\nAll you need is love, (Everybody)\nAll you need is love, love,\nLove is all you need\nAll you need is love\nAll you need is love\nAll you need is love, love\nThe words emerged from the mouth of John neutralize the glove attacks.\nJOHN\nGo, Glove, lovely Glove.\nRINGO\nYou took the words right out of my mouth, John.\nGEORGE\nHey, wait, and watch.

The word NO becomes NOW and then KNOW.\nShe loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah\nThe meanies flee and The Beatles are acclaimed by the crowd.\nA little bit further they find a blue glass ball.\nGEORGE\nHey, that's a funny place to leave a goldfish bowl.\nJOHN\nIn Pepperland all things are possible.\nPAUL\nIt's not a goldfish bowl.\nRINGO\nJust a big glass bowl, then.\nPAUL\nYes, blue glass.\nRINGO\nIt must be from Kentucky.\nPaul knocks the bowl.
